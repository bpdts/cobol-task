The purpose of this tech task is to look at your use of canonical Microfocus COBOL, in line with other skills that we would expect you to be using regularly. A discussion of your work will form a small part of the interview discussion. We would expect this task to only take you a couple of hours.

Steps
-----

* Pull this repository to your local machine.
* There is an index file in the [data](/data) directory.
* Create a Microfocus COBOL application to perform simple CRUD actions on the data.
* Push the code to a private repo, and contact us to get hold of a username which you'll need to give access so we can look at what you've done.
