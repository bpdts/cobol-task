Steps if you do no have a Microfocus Development Environment
------------------------------------------------------------

    * Pull this repository to your local machine.
    * There two files in the data directory:
        - An indexed sequential file with the single prime key, 3 bytes long, at the start of the record.
        - A COBOL copy file which contains the definition of the record in the other file.
    
    Either
    ------
    
    1. Having looked at the Copy file, write a document describing how you would approach the challenge of writing a program to create, read, update and delete records. You may use pseudocode or another form of COBOL to show the sort of code which you'd need to write. Refer to (INSTRUCTIONS.md)[/INSTRUCTIONS.md] for more information about the program's specification. Email us with the document.

    2. Using another variety of COBOL, for example (GnuCOBOL)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/], follow the instructions in (INSTRUCTIONS.md)[/INSTRUCTIONS.md]. Upload this code to a Git repository, or email it to us.
